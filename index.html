                <p> The Mumbai-based edutech startup has been facing flak on social for its advertisement across TV and digital platforms. It also invited outrage of parents and some tech experts.
                    So what exactly is WhiteHat Jr?
                    Founded in 2018, WhiteHat Jr is an ed-tech platform that teaches students coding through one-on-one video classes with instructors. The startup has been in news ever since edtech unicorn BYJU’S acquired it for USD 300 million.
                    Founded in 2018 by Karan Bajaj, WhiteHat Jr offers AI courses for children aged six to 14 years. WhiteHat Jr aims to empower children so that they view themselves as creators.
                    The app helps children learn computer programming and encourages them to create games, animations, applications and more. The startup works with a live one-on-one online teaching format and a thoroughly researched curriculum. The subjects range from data structure, app and game development to machine learning and space technology.

                <p> twinkling with mischief. He’s found himself a lockdown passion: Making YouTube videos on everything from cooking to stop motion with help from his parents, slowly amassing 800-odd subscribers. He’s also found himself in the midst of a controversy, as he faced a curious YouTube strike.
                    Haria filmed the first of a series of ‘advertisement roast’ videos last week, a format that dissects an advertisement that the creator considers meme-worthy, making jokes about the exaggerated plotlines and so on. He kicked off the series with speaking about an advert for WhiteHat Jr, an ed-tech startup that gives coding courses for children as young as six; within 18 months of operation, the startup was acquired by ed-tech giant Byju’s for $300 million in August.
                    The advert shows a group of people in suits charging into a home, punching and pushing each other in a race to get there. Out on the porch, a mother and father are watching the action with a smile, sipping their morning tea. A neighbour comes to see what the ruckus is about, and the mother is gleeful as she tells him that these are investors, rushing to bank on ‘Chintu’, their elementary school son who has built an app. The neighbour is visibly jealous.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> As WhiteHat Jr was acquired by Byju's for $300 million, the edtech startup became part of the multi-billion dollar online education empire. WhiteHat Jr, which provides coding classes for children, has, however, invited the wrath of parents and some tech experts in the recent time for its strategy, especially for its policy against criticism on social media platforms.
                    Pradeep Poonia, a software engineer with Cisco, said his account kept getting suspended as he tried to post about WhiteHatJr.
                    "WhiteHat Jr and Byju's are misusing their position, for more than a month I have been trying to post about WhiteHatJr. On whichever platform I go to, either my accounts get suspended or my posts get deleted," he wrote ina LinkedIn blog. </p>
